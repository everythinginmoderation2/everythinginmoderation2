- 👋 Hi, I’m @everythinginmoderation2
- 👀 I’m interested in health, music, the world outside of my bubble and learning...particularly things outside of my (MERN) original comfort zone.
- 🌱 I’m currently and constantly learning that javascript allows me so many choices for building and understanding a large portion of the www. The MERN stack may have been where I started, but strong-typing and OOP details are what will be mixing into my knowledge-base next.
- 
- In 2018, via FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy, I started and finished much of my intro HTML, CSS, Javascript. 

- By end of 2019 I had continued and completed the frontend portion of the FullStackDev Codecademy course. 

- By the last quarter of 2020, I had finished the backend portion of the Fullstack Codecademy course having learned so much. From data fetching, JSON, Express, MySQL and performance-testing with Mocha and Chai, I saw a glimpse into so many paths with no coach or someone to match me with any particular direction.

- Doing all of this while working full-time as a public school teacher provided me a lot of discipline and new knowledge but still no real direction or time. I knew that React was growing popular. I knew that it could potentially get me started in the industry. Afterall, who doesn't want to be paid to learn, practice and do what they enjoy?
- 
-   So in late 2020, I made an impromptu decision to start and complete as much of a full-stack coding intensive as I could. I started with the intention of drilling all things React (for frontend job prep), grew familiar with the rest of MERN on my way. I've been ready to grow more on all ends since. 
-   
- 🙌 I've grown so much. Aside from code, I've grown to understand and practice more of what the typical dev environment requires. Commands, git, github, npm, deployments, debugging, a bit of project managment basics (SCRUM) and so much more... I've successfully worked in successful teams to practice building neat little things. I'll continue to grow.
-   
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that might appreciate my enthusiasm about learning and my new abilitites.
